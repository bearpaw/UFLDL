UFLDL Exercises
===============


This is my solution to the *Unsupervised Feature Learning and Deep Learning* ([UFLDL](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial)) exercises.


Datasets
--------
To minimize the size of the code, I remove all the datasets from the package. Before running the code, you should download the following datasets and unpack to the corresponding directories.

1.  Dowload [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset by running the following command
	```bash
	./MNIST/get_mnist.sh
	```
2.  Download A subset of the STL10 Dataset ([stlSubset.zip](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/resources/stlSubset.zip))
    unpack to './cnn_exercise'
    ```bash
	./cnn_exercise/get_stl.sh
	```
3.  Sampled 8x8 patches from the STL-10 dataset ([stl10_patches_100k.zip](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/resources/stl10_patches_100k.zip))
    unpack to './linear_decoder_exercise'
4.  All .mat file should be downloaded from the [tutorial site](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial)
